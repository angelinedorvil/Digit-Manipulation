# Digit-Manipulation

Recursion and Array-Based Sequences
Objective: Developed a Python program to manipulate sequences of digits in a text file, arranging all even digits before odd ones using recursion and array-based techniques.

Key Contributions:

Utilized command-line arguments to take the name of a text file for sequence manipulation.
Employed file handling techniques to read and process lines from a text file.
Implemented a recursive arrange() function to rearrange sequences based on even and odd digits.
Recorded and displayed the total running time of the program.
